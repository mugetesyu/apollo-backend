## Why do you need to reset airbag modules?
  
Airbag modules are electronic devices that control the deployment of airbags in case of a collision. They store information about the crash, such as the impact speed, the seat belt status, and the airbag status. This information is useful for diagnosing the airbag system and determining the cause of the accident. However, once the airbag module records a crash data, it will lock itself and prevent the airbags from working again. This means that you need to replace or reset the airbag module before you can use your car safely.

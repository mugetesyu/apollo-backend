UNI ISO 4156 is a series of international standards that provide the data and indications necessary for the design, manufacture and inspection of straight (non-helical) side-fitting cylindrical involute splines. These splines are used for clearance, sliding and interference connections of shafts and hubs.

UNI ISO 4156 is based on the principle of the involute curve, which is a type of curve that has many applications in engineering and mathematics. An involute curve is generated by tracing the end point of a string that is unwound from a circle. The advantage of using involute curves for splines is that they allow for a constant angular velocity ratio between the shaft and the hub, regardless of the radial displacement.

The three parts of UNI ISO 4156 cover different aspects of straight cylindrical involute splines. Part 1: Generalities provides the basic definitions, symbols, formulas and tolerances for the design and calculation of splines. Part 2: Dimensions specifies the dimensions and profiles of the splines, as well as the tables of standard modules and numbers of teeth. Part 3: Inspection describes the methods and instruments for measuring and verifying the conformity of splines.
 
UNI ISO 4156 is compatible with other ISO standards related to splines, such as ISO 4156-4:2005, which deals with helical cylindrical involute splines, and ISO 14:1982, which deals with straight-sided splines for cylindrical shafts. UNI ISO 4156 is also compatible with other national standards, such as DIN 5480 (Germany), NF E22-141 (France) and BS 3550 (United Kingdom).

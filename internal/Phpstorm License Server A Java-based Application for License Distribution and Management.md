Phpstorm License Server is a Java-based application that allows you to assign licenses based on a per-machine licensing model. This means that if a single user runs multiple IDEs concurrently on different machines, it will consume multiple licenses. However, you can also configure Phpstorm License Server to use a floating licensing model, which means that licenses are allocated dynamically based on the number of concurrent users.
 
To use Phpstorm License Server, you need to download and install it on a server machine that is accessible from your network. You can find the latest version of Phpstorm License Server and its release notes at [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/license\_server/getting\_started.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/license_server/getting_started.html). You also need to have valid licenses for your JetBrains products, which you can purchase or request a trial at [https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/buy/](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/buy/).
 
Once you have installed Phpstorm License Server, you can access its web interface from any browser and configure its settings. You can add your licenses, view their status and usage, manage users and groups, set up notifications and logs, and more. You can also use the REST API to integrate Phpstorm License Server with your own tools and systems.
 
To connect your Phpstorm or other JetBrains IDEs to Phpstorm License Server, you need to enter the server URL in the license activation dialog. You can also use the command-line tool or environment variables to activate your IDEs. For more details on how to connect your IDEs to Phpstorm License Server, please refer to [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/license\_server/activating\_products.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/license_server/activating_products.html).

In this section, we will show you how to use Phpstorm License Server to set up a floating licensing model for your JetBrains products. A floating license allows you to use a product on any machine as long as the number of concurrent users does not exceed the number of licenses. This way, you can optimize the usage of your licenses and avoid wasting them on idle machines.
 
To enable the floating licensing model, you need to go to the Phpstorm License Server web interface and select the "Floating" option in the "License Model" section. You can also specify the maximum number of concurrent users per license and the timeout period for releasing unused licenses. You can also enable or disable the "Allow borrowing licenses" option, which allows users to borrow licenses for offline use.
 
After you have configured the floating licensing model, you need to restart your Phpstorm License Server for the changes to take effect. You can then connect your IDEs to Phpstorm License Server as described in the previous section. When you launch your IDE, it will request a license from Phpstorm License Server and consume one of the available licenses. When you close your IDE or disconnect from the network, it will release the license back to Phpstorm License Server and free it for other users.
 
You can monitor the usage of your floating licenses from the Phpstorm License Server web interface. You can see how many licenses are available, how many are in use, and who is using them. You can also revoke licenses from specific users or machines if needed. You can also view the history and statistics of your license usage and export them as CSV files.
 
Using the floating licensing model can help you make the most of your JetBrains products licenses and share them among your team members. You can also reduce the risk of license expiration or violation by ensuring that your licenses are always up-to-date and valid.

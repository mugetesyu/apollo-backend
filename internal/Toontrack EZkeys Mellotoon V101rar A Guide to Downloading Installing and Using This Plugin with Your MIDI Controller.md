If you are looking for a software instrument that can recreate the classic sounds of the Mellotron, you might want to check out Toontrack EZkeys Mellotoon V101rar. This is a sample-based instrument that offers 15 individual sounds, all captured from the original Mellotron keyboard that was used by many iconic bands in the 1960s and 1970s.
 
The Mellotron was a unique instrument that used magnetic tape loops to play back samples of real instruments, such as strings, brass, flutes, choirs, and more. It was one of the first "band in a box" keyboards that allowed musicians to create rich and diverse arrangements with a single instrument. However, it also had some limitations, such as a short note duration of eight seconds, a limited note range of 35 keys, and a noisy and unreliable mechanism.

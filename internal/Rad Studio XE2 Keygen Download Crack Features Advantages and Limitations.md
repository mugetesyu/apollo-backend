DataSnap is a powerful technology that enables you to build client/server applications that communicate over TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS or REST protocols. You can also create .NET and PHP DataSnap clients that connect to your DataSnap servers.
- You can improve your code quality and productivity with UML modeling. RAD Studio XE2 provides full two-way UML modeling capabilities with multiple diagram types, synchronization between code and models, documentation generation, and design patterns.

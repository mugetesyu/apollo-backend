## Benefits of Tekla Structures
 
Tekla Structures is not only a powerful and advanced software for BIM and structural engineering, but also a versatile and flexible solution that can bring many benefits to your projects. Here are some of the benefits of using Tekla Structures:

- You can streamline your work with Tekla Structures by creating, combining, managing, and sharing multi-material 3D models packed with valuable construction information. You can use Tekla Structures throughout the project, from conceptual planning to fabrication, construction, and maintenance, for design, detailing, and information management[^1^].
- You can create accurate, constructible models that have all the structural data you need to build and maintain any type of structure. Tekla models can deliver LOD 500-the highest level of development possible-making them truly constructible. High LOD, as-built models minimize costly surprises, RFIâs (requests for information), and result in more profitable projects[^1^].
- You can collaborate and integrate with other BIM tools and applications through open APIs and file formats. You can also import, export, and link your data with other software solutions, digital construction tools, and fabrication machinery for smoother workflows[^1^].
- You can model any type of structure of any material, or include several materials in one model. The software can interface with several analysis and design (A&D) packages through Tekla Open API. In addition, Tekla Structures links with A&D packages by file transfer. Supported formats include, for example, SDNF, CIS/2, and IFC[^1^].
- You can benefit from the localization of Tekla Structures to fit your local construction industry standards. The software is available in 17 languages and has 32 environments that include predefined region-specific settings and information. To make sure you off to a smooth start, you can also get local support and training[^1^].

Tekla Structures is a software that can help you achieve better projects with less time, cost, and effort. By learning how to use Tekla Structures effectively, you can enhance your skills and career prospects in the field of BIM and structural engineering.

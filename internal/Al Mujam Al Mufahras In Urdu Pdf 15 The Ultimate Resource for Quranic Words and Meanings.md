## What is Al Mujam Al Mufahras?
  
Al Mujam Al Mufahras is an Arabic term that means "the indexed dictionary". It is a type of dictionary that focuses on the words of the Quran and their occurrences in different verses.

For example, if you want to know how many times the word "salah" (prayer) appears in the Quran and where, you can look it up in Al Mujam Al Mufahras and find out that it appears 82 times in 67 verses. You can also see the exact verses and their surahs (chapters) and ayahs (verses) numbers.
